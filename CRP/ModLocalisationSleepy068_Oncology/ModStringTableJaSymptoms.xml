CD5 is a good immunohistochemical marker for T-cells, although not as sensitive as CD3. About 76% of T-cell neoplasms are reported to express CD5, and it is also found in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma (both being B cell malignancies), that do not express CD3.

				<Text>Neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), also called CD56, is a homophilic binding glycoprotein expressed on the surface of neurons, glia and skeletal muscle. Although CD56 is often considered a marker of neural lineage commitment due to its discovery site, CD56 expression is also found in, among others, the hematopoietic system. Here, the expression of CD56 is most stringently associated with, but certainly not limited to, natural killer cells. In anatomic pathology, pathologists make use of CD56 immunohistochemistry to recognize certain tumours. tumours that are CD56-positive are myeloma, myeloid leukemia, neuroendocrine tumours, Wilms' tumour, neuroblastoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, small cell lung carcinoma, and the Ewing's sarcoma family of tumours.</Text>

Pelvic masses may originate from either the gynaecologic organs, such as the cervix, uterus, uterine adnexa, or from other pelvic organs, such as the intestines, bladder, ureters, and renal organs. There are many gynecologic problems that can result in a pelvic mass. Additionally, there are other diseases that may also result in a pelvic mass. Most are benign conditions, such as an Ovarian Cyst, while others can be related to gynecologic cancer.</Text>

				<Text>Tumour protein p53, also known as p53, cellular tumour antigen p53 (UniProt name), tumour suppressor p53 is any isoform of a protein encoded by homologous genes in various organisms, such as TP53 (humans) and Trp53 (mice). This homolog (originally thought to be, and often spoken of as, a single protein) is crucial in multicellular organisms, where it prevents cancer formation, and thus functions as a tumour suppressor. The TP53 gene can also be modified by mutagens (chemicals, radiation, or viruses), increasing the likelihood for uncontrolled cell division.</Text>

				<LocID>SYM_CRP_CDF_T_23_DESC</LocID>
				<Text>Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the condition of genetic hypermutability (predisposition to mutation) that results from impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR). The presence of MSI represents phenotypic evidence that MMR is not functioning normally. MMR corrects errors that spontaneously occur during DNA replication, such as single base mismatches or short insertions and deletions. The proteins involved in MMR correct polymerase errors by forming a complex that binds to the mismatched section of DNA, excises the error, and inserts the correct sequence in its place. Cells with abnormally functioning MMR are unable to correct errors that occur during DNA replication and consequently accumulate errors. Microsatellite instability is associated with many forms of cancer but is most prevalent in associations with colon cancers.</Text>

				<Text>Mucin 4 (MUC 4) is a mucin protein that in humans is encoded by the MUC4 gene. Like other mucins, MUC-4 is a high-molecular weight glycoprotein. The major constituents of mucus, the viscous secretion that covers epithelial surfaces such as those in the trachea, colon, and cervix, are highly glycosylated proteins called mucins. These glycoproteins play important roles in the protection of the epithelial cells and have been implicated in epithelial renewal and differentiation. MUC-4 has been found to play various roles in the progression of cancer, particularly due to its signaling and anti-adhesive properties which contribute to tumour development and metastasis.</Text>

				<Text>Cadherin-1 also known as CAM 120/80 or epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) or uvomorulin is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CDH1 gene. CDH1 has also been designated as CD324 (cluster of differentiation 324). It is a tumour suppressor gene. Loss of E-cadherin function or expression has been implicated in cancer progression and metastasis. E-cadherin downregulation decreases the strength of cellular adhesion within a tissue, resulting in an increase in cellular motility. This in turn may allow cancer cells to cross the basement membrane and invade surrounding tissues.</Text>

				<Text>Mucins are a family of high molecular weight, heavily glycosylated proteins (glycoconjugates) produced by epithelial tissues in most animals. Mucin 2, oligomeric mucus gel-forming, also known as MUC2, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MUC2 gene. Mucin 2 is particularly prominent in the gut where it is secreted from goblet cells in the epithelial lining into the lumen of the large intestine. In Oncology, overexpression of MUC-2 might protect against antitumour immune effectors by forming a mucous layer, thus promoting tumour development.</Text>

MUC5AC is a molecule with versatile functional implications including barrier functions to epithelial cells, host–pathogen interaction, immune cell attraction to sites of premalignant or malignant lesions and tumor progression in a context-dependent manner. Differential expression, glycosylation and localization of MUC5AC have been associated with a plethora of benign and malignant pathologies.</Text>

MUC1 is a glycoprotein with extensive O-linked glycosylation of its extracellular domain. Mucins protect the body from infection by pathogen binding to oligosaccharides in the extracellular domain, preventing the pathogen from reaching the cell surface. Overexpression of MUC1 is often associated with colon, breast, ovarian, lung and pancreatic cancers.</Text>
